# People Over Process

### Sharpen Critical Thinking
- **Ask "Why" Five Times:** Encourage teams to dig beyond the surface to find the root cause.
- **Challenge Assumptions:** Create a safe environment to question the "givens."
- **Focus on Business Value:** Frame every task in the context of the client's goals.

**Detailed Notes for "People Over Process"**

**Sharpening Critical Thinking:**
- The "Five Whys" is a simple but powerful technique. If a client says "We need a new dashboard," don't just build it. Ask why. "Why do you need a new dashboard?" -> "Because we can't see our sales data." -> "Why can't you see it?" -> "Because the current report is too slow." -> "Why is it slow?" -> "Because the database query is inefficient." -> "Why is it inefficient?" -> "Because it wasn't designed for this kind of reporting." The root problem isn't the dashboard, it's the data structure. Solving that provides much more value.
- Psychological safety is key to challenging assumptions. Your team must know they won't be punished for speaking up, even if they're wrong. Leaders must model this behavior by being open to being challenged themselves.
- Connecting to business value changes the conversation from "I'm building a feature" to "I'm helping the client increase revenue by 5%." This is motivating and ensures alignment.

**Building Trust:**
- Empathy is about understanding the client's world. What are their personal and professional pressures? What does a "win" look like for them?
- Radical transparency means sharing bad news early. A client who finds out about a problem from you will see you as a partner. A client who discovers a problem on their own will see you as a vendor who hid something.
- Curiosity builds rapport. Ask about their industry, their career, their challenges. People want to work with people they like and who are genuinely interested in them.
