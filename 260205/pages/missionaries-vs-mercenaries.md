**Detailed Notes for "Missionaries vs. Mercenaries"**

This is a concept popularized by John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins. It's a fundamental distinction in team culture.

**Mercenaries:**
- They are skilled professionals who do good work. There is nothing inherently wrong with being a mercenary.
- However, their loyalty is to the paycheck. They will deliver exactly what is asked, but rarely more.
- They are less likely to challenge a client's bad idea, because their job is to fulfill the contract, not to guarantee the client's long-term success.
- This culture is easier to build but harder to sustain. It leads to high churn and a constant need to "sell" the next project.

**Missionaries:**
- They are driven by a purpose. They believe in the company's mission and the client's success.
- They see the client's problem as their own problem.
- They will challenge, innovate, and push back to ensure the *right* thing gets built, not just the *asked-for* thing.
- This creates immense trust and turns a client relationship into a true partnership.
- These are the teams that create breakthrough results.

# Driving a Missionary Culture

- **Define and Live the Mission:** Your purpose must be more than profit. It should guide hiring, project selection, and daily decisions.
- **Hire for Belief, Not Just Skill:** During interviews, ask about their proudest moments, their motivations, and the impact they want to have.
- **Empower and Trust Your Team:** Give them the "why" and the strategic goals, then give them the autonomy to figure out the "how." Micromanagement kills the missionary spirit.
