# From Vendor to Partner

It's not about what you build. It's about the **business outcome** you create.

**Detailed Notes for "Thinking Like a Partner"**

This is the core mindset shift. A vendor delivers a scope. A partner delivers an outcome. Our goal is to become partners. This means we measure our success not by whether the code is deployed, but by whether we moved the needle on a key business metric for our client.

# Shifting Your Focus

A simple change in perspective from a technical focus to a business focus.

This diagram shows the two mindsets. The vendor mindset is linear and focused on execution. The partner mindset is a cycle focused on value. It's about being involved in the "why" and the "so what," not just the "what."

# How to Think Like a Partner

- **Start with Strategic Context:** What are the client's biggest goals and challenges for the year?
- **Translate Tech to Business:** Frame problems in terms of Time, Money, or Risk.
- **Define Success with Metrics:** Agree on measurable KPIs before you start.
- **Speak the Language of Value:** Always answer the "So what?" for the client.
- **Think About People:** A solution no one uses is a failure. Plan for change.

# Before and After

A practical example of shifting the language.

::left::

### Before (Vendor-Speak)

"We need to refactor the authentication service and migrate the user database to a new server."

**Focus:** Technical tasks.

::right::

### After (Partner-Speak)

"We've identified a **risk** with the current login system. By improving it, we can increase security and cut user login **time** by 50%, saving an estimated 1,000 employee hours per year."

**Focus:** Business impact (Risk, Time, Money).
